This directory contains almost all of the coding work I did for ENEE140 and it is all written in C.
The Lab folders are all just weekly homework assignments, usually fairly basic.
The project folders contain code used for larger projects, of which we had around a month of time to complete each project. 
Project 1 is a random number generator, where numbers are generated using a linear congruential method.
Project 2 is a unique word counter, which caches each unique word and stores the number of times it is read in a file.
